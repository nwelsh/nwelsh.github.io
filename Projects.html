            <p1> In summer 2021, I worked with a company called Coding4Youth. Through this company, I was able to teach K-12 kids how to code! One of the classes I taught was Computer Science 105. This is a web development course. I made the lessons and assignments into a website. 
            <br/>The website can be found here: <a href = "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nwelsh/NicoleC4Y.github.io/blob/main/index.html"> Coding4YouthCS105 </a> </p1>
            <hr>
            <p1> Example of a page: </p1> <img src="Lesson12.jpg" alt="Lessons 1 and 2 Example" width = 100% height = "550px"> 
            This is the page for lessons 1 and 2. This has a brief explaination of the lessons, the homework assignments, and links to the chapters. The students used this as a place to find all their necessary information.

            <p1>  Additionally, for my Coding4Youth Computer Science 105 class, I made my lessons into HTML documents. I took the notes and compiled them into HTML pages so the student could do all the lesson's examples at once. 
                <br/> <a href = "https://github.com/nwelsh/Summer2021HTMLLessons"> Link to the pages </a></p1>

            <p1> Example of a page: </p1> <img src="lesson2.jpg" alt="Lesson 2 Example" width = 100% height = "500px"> 
            <p1> This is an example of one of the lessons. This is a beginner course so the students are learning basic ideas before learning how to design. </p1>

            <p1> I have been looking to broaden my knowledge on programming languages. I have been doing daily lessons to learn Python and C++. I make lessons and take notes in a github page. I use a visualizer or run the code to see the outcomes of it. Once I became more familiar with 
              Python, I referenced the algorithm from my Binary Search Tree in Java and worked through a BST in Python. </p1>
